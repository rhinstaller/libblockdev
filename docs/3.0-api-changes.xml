  <simplesect><title>Crypto plugin</title>

  <para>
    Crypto plugin API has been significantly changed. Most changes were introduced to simplify the API by removing various
    "redundant" functions that added new or optional parameters to the existing functions.
  </para>

  <para>
    `BD_CRYPTO_TECH_LUKS2` has been removed. We no longer distinguish between LUKS v1 and LUKS v2 support and libcryptsetup >= 2 is now required.
